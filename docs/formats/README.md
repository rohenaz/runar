# TSOP Multi-Format Input

TSOP's canonical input format is TypeScript (`.tsop.ts`). In addition, four **experimental** alternative input formats are available. All formats compile through the same pipeline and produce identical Bitcoin Script output for equivalent contracts.

---

## How It Works

The TSOP compiler auto-detects the input format by file extension:

| Extension | Format | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| `.tsop.ts` | TypeScript | Canonical format. Full IDE support via `tsc`. |
| `.tsop.sol` | Solidity-like | Familiar syntax for Ethereum developers. |
| `.tsop.move` | Move-like | Resource-oriented, inspired by Sui/Aptos Move. |
| `.tsop.go` | Go | Native Go syntax with struct tags. Go compiler only. |
| `.tsop.rs` | Rust DSL | Idiomatic Rust with attribute macros. Rust compiler only. |

All formats parse into the same `ContractNode` AST. From that point forward, the pipeline is identical: validate, typecheck, ANF lower, optimize, stack lower, emit.

```
  .tsop.ts ──┐
  .tsop.sol ──┤
  .tsop.move ─┼──► ContractNode AST ──► Validate ──► TypeCheck ──► ANF ──► Stack ──► Bitcoin Script
  .tsop.go ───┤
  .tsop.rs ───┘
```

## Format Comparison

| Feature | TypeScript | Solidity | Move | Go | Rust |
|---------|-----------|----------|------|-----|------|
| Status | **Stable** | Experimental | Experimental | Experimental | Experimental |
| IDE support | Full (`tsc`) | Syntax highlighting | Syntax highlighting | Full (`go vet`) | Full (`rustc`) |
| TS compiler | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| Go compiler | Yes | Yes | Yes | **Yes (native)** | No |
| Rust compiler | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | **Yes (native)** |
| Stateless contracts | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Stateful contracts | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| `addOutput` | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Ternary expressions | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Learning curve (from TS) | None | Low | Medium | Medium | Medium |

## Compiler Support Matrix

Each compiler has a primary native format plus support for the shared formats:

| Compiler | Native format | Also supports |
|----------|--------------|---------------|
| TypeScript (`tsop-compiler`) | `.tsop.ts` | `.tsop.sol`, `.tsop.move` |
| Go (`compilers/go`) | `.tsop.go` | `.tsop.ts`, `.tsop.sol`, `.tsop.move` |
| Rust (`compilers/rust`) | `.tsop.rs` | `.tsop.ts`, `.tsop.sol`, `.tsop.move` |

The Go format (`.tsop.go`) is only understood by the Go compiler. The Rust format (`.tsop.rs`) is only understood by the Rust compiler. All other formats are portable across all three compilers.

## Choosing a Format

- **TypeScript** is the recommended format for production use. It has the best tooling, is the canonical reference for the language spec, and is supported by all compilers.
- **Solidity-like** helps Ethereum developers transfer existing knowledge. The syntax is intentionally close to Solidity but compiles to Bitcoin Script.
- **Move-like** appeals to developers from the Sui/Aptos ecosystem who prefer resource-oriented thinking.
- **Go** is for teams already using the Go compiler who want to write contracts in idiomatic Go.
- **Rust DSL** is for teams already using the Rust compiler who want to write contracts in idiomatic Rust.

## Experimental Status

All non-TypeScript formats are **experimental**. This means:

1. The syntax may change in future releases without a deprecation cycle.
2. Edge cases may not be fully handled compared to the TypeScript parser.
3. Error messages from alternative parsers may be less precise than the TypeScript parser.
4. The conformance test suite covers all formats, but coverage may lag behind the TypeScript parser for newly added language features.

The underlying compilation pipeline (validate through emit) is the same regardless of input format and is fully stable.
